- 👋 Hi, I’m @edwardghbaker
- 👀 I’m interested in writing and developing codes, principally in python, for geologists and experimental petrologists. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, inparticular getting more familiar with tkinter/scipy and sklearn 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all of my codes, im also looking at writing some python specific diffusion modelling scripts for geologists. 
- 📫 best to get in touch on this platform, or just add @gmail.com to my username and drop me an email.
