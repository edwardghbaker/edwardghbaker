Hello,
Im Ed and Ive been writing python scripts mainly for geochemical or scientific problems so far, Im looking to branch out and continue to learn more and work on interesting projects. Any questions about my scripts can be directed to edwardghbaker@gmail.com. 

I will shortly be uploading scripts to tile .bcf image files and filtered by elemental X-ray line and EPMA processing script that classifies phases and accounts for contamination. 

The fO2 script has been converted to an android app, comments should be directed to edsExPetApps@gmail.com. 

- The painting code can be downlaoded and run on any python interpreter as is. Notes are found in withing the Room class if needed.
